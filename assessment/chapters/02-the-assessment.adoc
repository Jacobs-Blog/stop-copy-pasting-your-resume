== The Assessment

Your task is simple:  
Write your own resumé using AsciiDoc and generate a PDF version of it.

Please include at least the following sections:

- Your name and contact information
- A short professional summary (2–3 lines)
- A list of relevant tools or technologies
- Your professional experience (jobs, internships, or relevant projects)
- Education

You are free to style it however you like using AsciiDoc’s built-in formatting features (e.g., tables, lists, callouts, attributes). Bonus points for using reusable patterns like includes or variables.
