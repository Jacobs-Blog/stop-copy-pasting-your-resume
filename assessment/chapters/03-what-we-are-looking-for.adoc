== What We Are Looking For

We are not grading you on graphic design. Instead, we're looking at:

- How clearly you structure your content
- How well you understand and use AsciiDoc features
- Attention to detail and consistency
- Whether the final PDF looks clean and professional

It’s okay if you’ve never used AsciiDoc before—part of the challenge is figuring out how to use it. You can find resources and documentation at https://asciidoctor.org.
