== How To Submit

Please submit both of the following:

1. Your AsciiDoc source file (`resume.adoc`)
2. The rendered PDF (`resume.pdf`)

You can either:
- Upload both files via the submission link we sent you, **or**
- Push them to a public GitHub repo and share the link with us

If you get stuck, just let us know. We’re not expecting perfection—just insight into how you approach writing and tooling.

Thanks again, and good luck!
